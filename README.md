FixitPy is an uncomplicated Python library for interfacing with iFixit's API.

Allowing repair guides to be programmatically retrieved.
## Installation

````bash
pip install fixitpy
````

## Usage

### Guide retrieval

````py
import fixitpy

# Call 'retrieve_guide' returns the guide's dictionary
found_guide = fixitpy.retrieve_guide(123)

# As any regular dictionary, you can retrieve specific values from it
print(f"Title: {found_guide.get("title")}")
print(f"Difficulty: {found_guide.get("difficulty")}")
print(f"Conclusion: {found_guide.get("conclusion")}")

# The dictionary returned from 'retrieve_guide' contains a list refered to as 'steps'
# Each list item contains a dictionary with the properties 'title', which is self explanatory and 'text', the process itself.
for step in found_guide.get("steps"):
    print(step.get("title"))
    print(step.get("text"))

````

### Media retrieval

````py
import fixitpy

# Call 'retrieve_media', returns the media's dictionary
found_guide = fixitpy.retrieve_media(123)

# As any regular dictionary, you can retrieve specific values from it
print(found_guide.get("width"))
print(found_guide.get("height"))

# The dictionary returned from 'retrieve_media' contains a sub-dictionary under 'sizes'
# Which contains all the sizes of the media and their corresponding URLs.
sizes = found_guide.get("sizes")

# 'thumbnail' is a very common size for iFixit Media
print(sizes.get("thumbnail"))
